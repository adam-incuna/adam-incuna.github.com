# Technical debt: So you own a house

Suppose you own (or rent) a house, and you live in it, as people with houses are wont to do. Your possessions take up space, but you have shelves and drawers to put everything in.

Over time, you buy more stuff. You need a new set of kitchen knives. A vase. A photo frame. Some car repair tools. Hobby material. Whatever it is that sensible people buy. At first, slotting your newly acquired items into your existing storage isn't too difficult, but soon it starts getting awkward. You can mostly shuffle stuff around in-place to squeeze things in, and you get by on doing that for a while. The beanbag chair sits unloved in a corner behind the sofa, your old TV that's not quite worth throwing away finds itself at the bottom of a wardrobe, your paperwork tray overflows and gets another three trays stapled on top of it.

You don't realise quite how bad it's gotten until you realise you need something and spend two hours looking for it in the wrong room. It takes you so long because you have to haul everything aside to search all the corners, and you realise that you can make some small improvements along the way that ought to help avoid this situation in future. Ought to, anyway. It becomes quickly apparent that the old TV hasn't gotten any smaller (but you still need it for when you have a bunch of people around once every month or two) and the space under your bed really doesn't quite have the vertical room you wish it did. You make a vague plan to buy some drawers to put under there, to help with organisation, but you never quite get around to it. They're expensive and you know it won't achieve all that much anyway.

Surely, it's doable, though. I mean, you recognise fully well that this is not the organisation system you want - you're doing it wrong. There must be a right way. Kitchen things in the kitchen, bedroom things in the bedroom... But as you process the task ahead of you, you realise you don't have a free weekend for quite some time, and there are just enough corner cases that you can't really ignore them. Your dining room isn't big enough to fit the new dresser that would hold all your crockery and pans. The doorway to the second bedroom won't let you put the double bed in there. And how on earth are you going to afford another new sofa, even if you can get rid of the existing one?

Also, where do you even start? You have to move stuff off the shelves to put it back on, and there's nowhere for it all to really go. You'd have to pull everything off at once and re-layout the entire house in one go. Possibly even knock through the wall between the kitchen and dining room to make for a bit more space. Yes, that'd make things a lot easier, even if it is expensive and impractical and time-consuming...

You know what? Screw it. You'll just make sure to do it properly next time you move.
